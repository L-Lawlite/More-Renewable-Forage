# More Renewable Flora
Adds the ability for some small flowers and non-renewable plants like lily pad and spore blossom to be duplicated with bonemeal.

## For Developers if you want to add that to your own mod/through datapack.
- Add the block to `more_renewable_flora:duplicate_with_bonemeal` block tag. If that block inherits from `VegetationBlock` or `SporeBlossomBlock` classes.
- If it is not working after adding it in tag, or you want it to work with some other class. Contact me on GitHub (through issue), discord (`@lawliet__`), or through comments/dm.
